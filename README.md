# Artist Puzzle Game

This project includes a simple React-based sliding puzzle implemented entirely in `index.html`.

## Running

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. The puzzle uses local image and audio files from `public/assets`.

- **Puzzle Image:** `public/assets/IMG_4557.jpeg`
- **Win Audio:** `public/assets/so alive 10sec.wav`

When the puzzle is solved, the audio will loop automatically and a message appears with a button to claim your reward.
